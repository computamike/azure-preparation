| Agility    | This is a measure of how quickly an application can be deployed to the cloud environment.  This is from submitting the request through to the code being on the server(s)                                      |
| Elasticity | This is the "In case of a data centre going down - how would you recover".  Elasticity provides a "no down time" approach because you have located your application on 2 datacentres in different geographies. |
